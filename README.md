## Introduction
This is a dashboard that allows user to deposit/withdraw money from there wallets. It then allows users to buy and sell shares of the top 100 cryptocurrency assets. Our wallets are based in USD.
Warning: Crypto currencies are very vilotile and users trade at their own risk. We are not providing finacial advice and suggest all users trade with money that they can afford to lose. 



## Setup Instructions
To get started, just deposit a desired amount into your wallet. Any funds in your wallet can be withdrawn at any time. Deposited money that has been used to purchase any crypto assets, the shares of that asset must be liquidated before that money can be withdrawn. 
Scroll through the top 100 crypto assets on the left, you can add any of them to your watchlist that you would like to. Once in the watchlist, shares of an asset can be bought and sold as desired (assuming your wallet has the liquid funds). When a watchlist asset is clicked, you can view how many shares of it you own on the left side of the screen. Assets can only be removed from the watchlist if you do not own any outstanding shares of that cryptocurrency. Click the "Sell All" button on the asset if you wish to sell all shares and remove it from your watchlist.
